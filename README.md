# Machine Learning Course Project: Mall Customer Clustering

## Overview
This repository contains the project for my machine learning course, focusing on clustering analysis using the MeanShift algorithm. The dataset used in this project pertains to mall customers, with features including Customer ID, Gender, Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: This directory contains the dataset used for analysis. The primary file is mall_customer_data.csv, which includes the raw data.

- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, preprocessing, and clustering analysis are stored here. The main notebook is Group11_Project.ipynb.

- `src/`: This directory contains any source code or scripts used in the project. The primary script is mean-shift-clustering.py, implementing the MeanShift clustering algorithm.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mall-customer-clustering.git
cd mall-customer-clustering
```

2. Install Dependencies:
```

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the Analysis:
- Open and run the clustering_analysis.ipynb notebook in the notebooks/ directory.

4. Explore Results:
- Review the results and insights obtained from the clustering analysis in the notebook.

## Dependencies
* Python 3.7+
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn

## Results
The Mean Shift clustering algorithm has been applied to the mall customer dataset, providing insights into customer segmentation based on their annual income and spending score.

## Future Work
Future improvements or extensions to this project could include exploring alternative clustering algorithms, conducting hyperparameter tuning, or incorporating additional features for a more comprehensive analysis.
